Tenserflow course by deep lizard
My introduction to deep learning with the use of tensorflow

# Key takeaways
Setting up a PC to allow for tensorFlow to use your GPU with the use of CUDA and CuDNN
Structuring basic Sequential models
Using a gradient decent optimizer (in this case: Adam) these are used to calculate how the weights of the model should be altered. 
Activation options such as relu and softmax
How batch_size and epochs affect the models accuracy
How to use a confusion matrix to assess the accuracy of your model.
